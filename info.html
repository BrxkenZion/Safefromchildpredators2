  <h2> Who is an online predator? </h2>
     </p>
     <p> Online predators are individuals who commit child sexual abuse that begins or takes place on the internet. They exploit vulnerable children for sexual or other abusive purposes.</p>
     <p>They use chat rooms, instant messaging or social messaging sights to lure/solicit children for sexual or other abusive purposes. </p>
     <h2 class="Howtheydoit"> How do they do that? </h2>
     <p> Their main goal is to manipulate a child into believing that they care for them more than their parents, family and friends.</p>
     <p> They create a fictitious online personality that replaces the trusted parent/ guardian in the child's mind. <p>
<h2> Methods used by child predators: <h2>
  <!-- P20 PUT IT AAAAA -->
  <p>They spend a long time breaking down a child, making them feel comfortable enough to divulge personal info. </p>
  <p>Grooming: They develop relationships by offering what the child seems to need- emotionally or literally with gifts.</p>
      <p> Some children who feel sad, bored and lonely and otherwise challenged, turn to the internet to having their needs met. </p>
      <p> Fishing: An online predator will fish for info by asking basic questions, they combine all their bits of information to get a profile together. </p>
      <h1> How to prevent online predators </h1>
        <h2> Here are some ways to prevent you or your child from getting attacked by online predators: </h2>
        <p> There are a number of steps you can take to protect your kids from online predators. Here are some of them:</p>
        <ul>
      <li>Talk to your kids about sexual predators and explain about potential online dangers. Explain about the grooming process and warn them about some of the tactics an online predator may use.
 </li>
      <li>Install parental control software. Most of them can identify and block harmful content in chats, forums and other internet communication tools (or just alert you about them, if you so choose).
Don’t forget to inform your children that you have done this. Explain to them that that you are not spying on them - you are keeping them safe!!</li>
      <li> Place the computer in a family room or somewhere visible (not in your child’s bedroom). But remember that your children have other means of accessing the Internet and communicating with potential predators. Pay attention to other computer and Internet-enabled mobile devices.
</li>
      <li>Most social networking sites require that users be age 13 and over. Make sure your kids follow these age restrictions.  </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Make sure you follow these rules of thumb for chat rooms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Young children should not be allowed to use chat rooms at all.</li>
      <li> Older kids should be directed to monitored kids' chat rooms.</li>
      <li> Get to know the chat rooms your kids do visit and with whom they talk. Check to see the kind of conversations that take place. Chat rooms featuring subjects that attract children and teenagers, such as music, sports, or fashion, are prime targets of child sexual predators, who often disguise themselves as peers. </li>
    </ul>
<h2> A few tips for your kids</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Never download images from an unknown source, or upload sexually suggestive images of yourself to the internet</li>
  <li> Tell an adult you trust (parent, teacher, etc.) immediately if anything that happens online makes you feel uncomfortable or frightened.
</li>
<li> Choose a gender-neutral screen name. Make sure the name you choose does not contain sexually suggestive words or reveal personal information. Avoid screen names that have words like girl, boy, princess, prince, Barbie, flower, or numbers that may indicate age, zip code or area code. Also avoid screen names that have school mascot or logos in it.
</li>
<li>Never reveal personal informationabout yourself (including age and gender) or about the family to anyone online. Do not fill out online personal profiles. </li>
<li> Stop any e-mail communication, instant messaging conversations, or chats if anyone starts to ask questions that are too personal or sexually suggestive.
</li>
<li> Never agree to meet someone in person that you’ve met on-line. </li>
<li> Remember that what you are told on-line may or may not be true.</li>
</ul>
